The source code should be ran using the NetBeans IDE.(version 8.0.2 would be better)

After opening the NetBeans IDE you can open the project named playlist_test directly.
The main file is the playlist_UI.java, you can run that file directly to see our UI and try all the functions. Other useful files are Trie.java and TrieNode.java.

Our group members are: Hao Wu, Siwan Yang and Ying Shi.

Thanks!
